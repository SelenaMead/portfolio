    <h2> My Background</h2>
    <p>
      For the past few years I have worked for <a href="https://results-cx.com/">ResultsCX</a> as a call center <br>supervisor. I recently quit to join this program
      and hopefully get a job as a software developer. I don't have much history in tech other than a 2 year program i took
      in highschool to learn coding.

    <h2>Why I want to become a webdeveloper</h2>
    <p>
      I want to become a developer because I enjoy working with
      computers. I enjoy <br>creating things, even if I am not the most creative
      person. </p>
